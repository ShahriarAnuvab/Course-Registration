1. **Course Details Display:** Users should be able to view detailed information about each course, including the course name, description, credit hour and price . This information can help them make informed decisions about which courses to register for.
2. **Course Cart:** Implement a shopping cart feature that allows users to add courses they are interested in. This cart should display the selected courses, including their names and prices. Users should be able to easily add and remove courses from their cart.
