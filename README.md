**3 Project Feature**
1. **Course Details Display:** Users should be able to view detailed information about each course, including the course name, description, credit hour and price . This information can help them make informed decisions about which courses to register for.
2. **Course Cart:** Implement a shopping cart feature that allows users to add courses they are interested in. This cart should display the selected courses, including their names and prices. Users should be able to easily add and remove courses from their cart.
3. **Validation for Duplicate Courses:** To prevent users from adding the same course multiple times, you can implement validation logic. When a user tries to add a course they've already added, display a toast or a pop-up message informing them that the course is already in their cart.
4. **Cart Total:** Show users the total cost of the courses in their cart. This can help users keep track of their expenses and make decisions about which courses to keep in their car.
